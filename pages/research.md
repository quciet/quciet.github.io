## Presentations & Workshops
<!-- Presentation list can be expanded in the future -->
- Multiple Imputation with Simulated Non-Normal Missing Variable at Level 2  
  <small>*AERA 2019 Annual Meeting, Toronto, Canada*</small>  
  Simulated nested data structures to evaluate the performance of missing data imputation with non-normal variables at higher levels. The study revealed how non-normality and sample size affect imputation accuracy.

## Projects & Reports

- The Minerva Initiative: Identifying Patterns in the Structural Drivers of Intrastate Conflict  
  <small>*Pardee Center, University of Denver (2021–2022)*</small>  
  Developed automated pipelines to compile intrastate conflict observations and drivers. Applied hierarchical clustering to identify three distinct conflict patterns. Conducted sensitivity analyses and visualization in R.

- From Insights to Action: Gender Equality in the Wake of COVID-19  
  <small>*Pardee Center, UN Women & UNDP Collaboration (2020)*</small>  
  Compiled and analyzed multidimensional poverty data using principal component analysis across 90+ variables. Built predictive models to understand the dynamic between poverty and gender inequality across global contexts.

- Conditions for Success in the Implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement  
  <small>*Pardee Center, commissioned by the African Union Development Agency (2019–2020)*</small>  
  Built a 40GB SQL-based dataset of trade and tariff data. Calculated trade complementarity indices and developed dyadic models to evaluate the economic fit and implementation conditions of the free trade agreement.
