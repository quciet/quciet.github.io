Hello! I’m Yutang Xiong, a Ph.D. candidate in Research Methods and Statistics at the University of Denver, with a passion for data-driven insight and applied quantitative research. I hold an M.A. in Statistics from the University of Missouri-Columbia and a B.S. in Mathematics from Hunan University.

My academic and professional journey bridges deep statistical theory with hands-on experience in data engineering, modeling, and analytics. Currently, I serve as the Lead Data Operations Manager at the Pardee Institute for International Futures, where I design and maintain robust databases, develop automated data pipelines, and apply advanced analytics to global development challenges.

I specialize in statistical learning, text mining, clustering, predictive modeling, and data visualization, with a strong command of Python, R, and SQL. My work integrates complex data from diverse domains—conflict, gender equality, trade, and development—to support policy-making and long-term strategic planning.

Outside of research and data, I enjoy contributing to academic workshops, mentoring students, and exploring the intersection of computation and global systems.
