# Personal Site

This repository contains the source for my Jekyll-based personal website.

Top-level Markdown files have been moved into the `pages/` directory to keep the project root tidy. The site navigation continues to use the same permalinks so URLs are unaffected.

## Usage

Install dependencies and serve locally:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
