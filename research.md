## 🔍 Doctoral Research
**Multiple Imputation with Simulated Non-Normal Missing Variable at Level 2**  
*University of Denver | Presented at AERA 2019*  
Simulated nested data structures to evaluate the performance of multi-level vs. single-level imputation under non-normal missingness at higher levels. The study revealed how non-normality and sample size affect imputation accuracy.

## 🔬 Minerva Initiative Project
**Identifying Patterns in the Structural Drivers of Intrastate Conflict**    
*University of Denver (2021–2022)*    
Developed automated pipelines to compile intrastate conflict observations and drivers. Applied hierarchical clustering to identify three distinct conflict patterns. Conducted sensitivity analyses and visualization in R.

## 🌐 African Continental Free Trade Agreement Readiness
*African Union Development Agency (2019–2020)*    
Built a 40GB SQL-based dataset of trade and tariff data. Calculated trade complementarity indices and developed dyadic models to evaluate the economic fit and implementation conditions of the free trade agreement.

## 🌿 Leaf Classification – Kaggle Competition
*Ranked Top 10% among 1,000+ teams*    
Applied ensemble methods, deep learning, and SVMs using R's h2o package. Achieved <1% classification error and log-loss <0.05 through optimized model tuning and validation.
